## Sustainable Portfolio Construction Final Project
#### Henry Maier, Ryan Chin, Sheyla Sedano-Rosas

### Local Setup
To run these notebooks locally, we reccomend using a Python dependency manager like [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Setup steps using conda follow, but feel free to use anything you'd like to manage Python dependencies.

1. Clone this repo.
2. `cd` into the directory you just cloned. Setup a new conda environment using `conda create --name sustainablepf --file requirements.txt`.
3. Activate this environment `conda activate sustainablepf`
4. Use `jupyter notebook notebooks` to open a browser window where you can interact with the notebooks! Change the tickers in `constants.py` to generate visualization for more/ different ETFs.
